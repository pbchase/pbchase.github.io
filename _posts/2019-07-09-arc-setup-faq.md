The [Peter Lynn ARC set-up FAQ](../assets/documents/arc_setup_faq/) was for many years the authoritative reference for lovers of the Peter Lynn's ARC kites. It disappeared, but not before a few people scraped the Website to preserve if for posterity. I present it here as it was when I heard it was about to disappear.  It has some small gaps, but it's better than nothing.

If anyone has copies of these files, please send them my way and I'll add them in:
