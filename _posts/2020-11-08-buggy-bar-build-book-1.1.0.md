I'm pleased to announce the release of version 1.1.0 of the Buggy Bar Build Book. This release describes new features in the Buggy Bar including a simplified version of the separation block and the mini-chickenloop. The construction tasks are clearer both in text and in pictures. I offer more alternatives where they could simplify the work. I provide more details on the [cleat bead](../no-more-stoppers/). In all, I think the Buggy Bar is easier and faster to build in this release of the book. 

As before, the [BuggyBar Build Book](../assets/documents/buggy_bar_build_book_1.1.0/) is available online, as a [PDF](../assets/documents/buggy_bar_build_book_1.1.0/buggy_bar_build_book.pdf) and as an [ePub](../assets/documents/buggy_bar_build_book_1.1.0/buggy_bar_build_book.epub)
