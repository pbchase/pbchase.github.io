Today I'm releasing a project I first started in April of 2014. I had hoped to describe the bars I have been making in a single document that would allow others to do the same, but it never got close enough to done to be released. Though I've released a lot of components with open source licenses and written about specific advancements, I never brought all of the details of how to build one of my kite bars together. Now I am fixing that with the release of [BuggyBar Build Book](../assets/documents/buggy_bar_build_book/) The book is also available in [PDF](../assets/documents/buggy_bar_build_book/buggy_bar_build_book.pdf) and as an [ePub](../assets/documents/buggy_bar_build_book/buggy_bar_build_book.epub)

The book will evolve over time. Even as I write this, I see gaps in the book that need to be addressed, but it's at a state where a careful reader could recreate what I have done. With revisions to the book, that should get easier.
