I think it's time to say goodbye to a design I have been refining for the past 5 years. For quite some time I've felt the moveable stopper was critical part of a good bar. I've spent a lot of time learning how to [machine](../moveable-stoppers/) them and how to [3D print](../printing-a-moveable-stopper/) them. I've enjoyed the design process and using the products of my labors. I think I've produced some good designs and I'm happy with latest iteration, but for the past several months I've been thinking they are a compromise of both function and safety with only a moderate benefit. I've been flying with my stoppers pushed to the cleat since last Fall. Though they were installed, I was no longer moving them off the cleat.

I had noticed some years back that the most performant way to fly was to not fully use the ball as the limit on the bar. Instead, push the stopper a little further away then "optimal" and then hold the bar at the center about a finger's width off the ball. This gave you the opportunity to pull in when needed or let out a little in a gust. Yet if you really needed to let the bar out in a gust it took a moment to shift your hand and push the stopper out. It was not fully responsive to rapid changes in conditions. I did take advantage of it at times two finger flying holding the bar end while the ball carried the bar load, but this was rare for me.

I think the nail in the coffin though was last October when Steve Bateman asked me about Board Riding Maui's [Cloud Connection System](../cloud-connection-system). I had seen the videos before but Steve got me to review it once more and I was reminded of the many things I liked about the design. What intrigued me the most was passive safety provided by the massive bar throw. I wanted that. It just seemed like such a smart idea. I started question the wisdom of normal habit of flying with the bar at high load barely above the stopper. It meant that my fastest response was to steer toward the kite in a gust--not always an option. I had to acknowledge there were times when I flew with the bar well off the stopper to allow me to dump load during turns to avoid slides. So what was the point of the stopper then? The only use case remaining to take the load off my hands during long tacks. I simply didn't do it that much. So I pushed the stoppers on my bars out. 

Now that I wasn't moving the stoppers any more it raised the question of their utility. The features I was still using were the spherical shape of the ball to spin the bar, the groove in the ball for the flag line path, and the guide for the flag line in the block. The flag line guide in the block has always been the most fiddly part of the moveable stoppers. The stopper can rotate relative to cleat knocking the flag line guide path out of alignment with the cleat. You can twist the block into alignment with the cleat but it will drift again. So the ball needed to stay, but the block could go if I could think of any way to improve the guide path.

It wasn't long before I decided I wanted to integrate the ball into the end of the cleat. If I could control the ball's rotation relative to the cleat I could make a really good flag line guide path. I had done solid modeling using subtractive volumes and realized that subtracting the volume of the lower end of the cleat from a sphere might provide the shape I needed. I created a 3d scan of the cleat and did just that.  With some iteration, the sphere flared to more of a helmet shape, grew a little, acquired an integrated flag line guide path and a tight fit onto the base of the cleat.
