## Moveable stoppers

I my early exploration into bar construction I saw posts from Mark Groshens on Power Kite Forum describing _longthrow_ bar construction. The concept is to build a control system with lots of travel for the bar. This allows for a large and rapid depower. In some designs there is enough travel to reach zero bar pressure and the absolute maximum depower the kite can provide. 

The work Mark described was with Arcs and is documented in the [Arc Setup FAQ](http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/mx5alan/arcs/ARCsetup_FAQ.htm "Arc Setup FAQ"), specifically the section _Control Bars - Custom Designs_. The Arc Setup FAQ describes a long throw design with a doubled trim line, trim control below the bar, an adjustable line stopper that bends the paths of the pair of trim lines.

The stopper ball can be moved up and down the trim line while underway to limit the maximum excursion of the bar up the trim line. The bend in the trim line path allows the ball to hold its position with bar pressure against. At least that's the idea. I never built a stopper exactly like the one shown here. I wasn't sure the bars I was using would bend the line back and create the friction needed to keep the stopper in place. The bars shown in the design are, I believe, from Peter Lynn '04 or '07 control systems. These bars have a fairly narrow, perfectly round hole for the trim line. Such a passageway would force the trim lines together regardless of orientation. Some of the bars I was using had ovalized bores which I feared would catch on the spread trim lines coming out of the single-piece stopper. As such, I never made or tested _this_ stopper. Having not tested it, I can only speculate how exactly the stopper would have behaved.

## Two-piece stoppers

I elected to build my stoppers in two pieces: A block above to spread the trim lines on the pilot's side with a ball below to bring them back together. The critical bend in the lines happens between the block and the ball. To make them function as a unit with single-handed control, they are joined with a segment of shock cord.

To move the two piece stopper you push the block toward the kite or pull the ball towards yourself. When the bar hits the ball, the ball will settle into the block, bend the trim line and not move further. 

My first blocks were made of wood, but it proved problematic to manufacture. I quickly moved to Delrin acetal. Delrin is easy to work with wood-working tools, but lacks the complexities of wood grain. It's stable in moisture and slippery against line, plastic, metal and wood. 

The very first blocks had parallel pathways for the trim line.  These stopped the bar just fine but the spread of the trim lines above the block was problematic. If you have a ring between the block and the cleat, gravity will send the ring down onto the spread trim line and cause the ring to stick. With the trim lines pressing against its inner diameter, the ring can't spin freely when it needs to. The jammed ring can also impede the block's motion up the trim line when the pilot pushes it. The ideal dimensions allow the ring to rest on top of the block without any pressure on the trim line.

Another more subtle issue is the minimum distance between the block and the cleat. As the trim lines enter the cleat, they can be adjacent to one another. If they are not adjacent to one another as they exit the block, they must take an angled path and the block cannot be pushed all the way to the cleat. It's a small thing but for shorter pilots every millimeter between yourself and the cleat is a problem.

## The Ball

The ball on the bottom of the stopper controls the interface of the stopper and the bar. Bringing the trim lines back together assures they can never press against the bore of the bar. The trim lines won't impede travel or spin. Nor will they cause unnecessary abrasion of the bar's bore.

Using a sphere and a round rim on the kite-side of the bar's bore assures the bar can self-center on the trim line and spin freely. The low friction of the Delrin further reduces impediments to a free spinning bar. These features allow the bar to spin freely even under high load if that is desired.

## Where do we go from here?

This the early design of the stopper created before I made accommodations for a flag line. That's an article for another day, but everything here still applies when solving that problem.
