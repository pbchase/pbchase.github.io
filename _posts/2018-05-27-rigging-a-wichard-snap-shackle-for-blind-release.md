## Quick release options without a chicken loop

As of this writing, most kite control bars use a feature called a _chicken loop_ to engage the bar with a hook on the harness the flier wears around the waist or torso. The chicken loop allows for a positive lock with the hook or for easy or even blind hooking and unhooking. The chicken loop also provides for a quick release mechanism to separate the bar from the harness hook. Some chicken loops incorporate a swivel. Some provide a now-twisting pathway for a flag line. 

Whereas these are valuable features for most water kiters, some of them are not valuable to a kite buggier. A buggier is interested in the positive lock between bar and harness and the quick release. The swivel is often helpful. A flag line pathway is required if a flag line will be used. Optimizing for these features can lead to a different solution from that used by water kiters and land boarders. 

One liability of the chicken loop is its length. It places the bar and all of its controls further away from the flier. The reduces bar through or makes reaching the trim control more difficult and at times more dangerous. That effect is exacerbated by the hook the chicken loop connects to. To maximize the bar through and bring the trim controls closer to the flier, alternative designs should reduce the distance from the fliers navel to the bottom of the bar at full bar throw. 

## Wichard Snap Shackle

A popular option for replacing the chicken loop is the Wichard snap shackle.

This shackle and its peers are described by Wichard in [Quick release snap shackles](http://marine.wichard.com/rubrique-Quick_release_snap_shackles-0202040300000000-IM.html). This family of Wichard shackles provides an extremely reliable release not seen in other products--even those from Wichard. 

These shackles are generally equipped with a small cord which, when pulled down, lowers a wire gate. When the wire gate drops far enough the hinged gate pivots from the top of the shackle releasing any line retained by the gate.

The release cord works very well in non-urgent situations when you can see the cord and have clearance to pull the cord down. Unfortunately, few of those requirements can be met when a kite buggier most needs to release the kite. In an emergency, there is very little time to search around for a small cord. The shackle and cord are rarely in the fliers site line. The space below cord is often occupied by a harness that might impeded an easy downward pull. 


## Swiveling: good and bad

The difficulties of finding the shackle's pull cord or a handle attached to it can be exacerbated by the use of a swivelling shackle. While the swivel allows the flier to remove simple line twist, the untwisting process adds uncertainty to the cord's position. The constantly shifting orientation of the shackle can leave the cord end opposite the hand that reaches to pull it. 


## Releasing in any orientation

To address these problems I borrowed an idea shared on [Powerkiteforum](http://www.powerkiteforum.com/) some years back. A forum member posted picture of a Wichard snap shackle with a short segment of twisted wire rope passing through the wire gate of the shackle. On either end of the gate was a cone facing toward the wire gate and a pull to provide a handle. When pulling one ball, the opposite cone would be pulled into the wire gate and release the hinged gate.

I adapted this design in a few 3d-printed iterations until I produced a cone and handle combination that looks something like a traffic cone or an inverted golf tee.

## How to make and assemble a set of handles

To use the traffic cone/golf tee style, print a pair of the handles in PLA with 80% infill, 3 shells, and 0.2 mm layers. The design for the handle is available in [OpenSCAD](https://github.com/pbchase/kite_bar_parts/blob/master/wichard_snaphook_handle_golf_tee_style.scad) and [STL](/images/wichard_snaphook_handle_golf_tee_style_8677c59.stl) formats.  To reduce the friction from the surface texture of the printing process, sand the cone of each handle smooth with 220-grit paper. 

Assemble the cones with the shackle on a short, folded, segment of 300# Spectra line that passes through the release gate of the snap shackle. The narrow tip of each piece faces the shackle. The Spectra is folded in half, tied with a figure eight knot at the loose end.  The folded end is pulled through the entire assembly with a wire fid. The folded end of the line is locked in place by a very short segment of line knotted and larksheaded on the end. The knots and the larks head are recessed inside the handles. The prevent the handles from pulling off the line ends and off the shackle.

## How to use a set of handles

When pulled, the handle pulls the opposite cone into the wire gate to open the snap shackle. Any rope passing through the hinged gate will be released.

This mechanism can be used to capture any depower bar that has a loop in the center below the bar. For a conventional depower bar it can capture the chickenloop, yet the greatest opportunity is in eliminating the chickenloop and attaching the the shackle directly to a lower loop of a doubled trim line.

## Which shackles to use

The handle shown here was developed to open the Wichard Quick release snap shackles. These two sizes have been tested with this cone shape.

There are other options for shackles that might work equally as well. The [Wichard Speedlink](http://marine.wichard.com/rubrique-SPEEDLINK-0202040201000000-IM.html) and [Tylaska T5 Snap Shackles](http://www.tylaska.com/index.php/snap-shackles/t5/). The Tylaska's have been discussed in the thread [triggered snap shackle for possible aqr](http://www.powerkiteforum.com/viewthread.php?tid=33055#pid316339) on [Powerkiteforum](http://www.powerkiteforum.com/). These styles would require a release cone with different dimensions. Tylaska offers [Cone fids](http://www.tylaska.com/index.php/fids/cone-fids/) that could be used with balls and cord as part of a release mechanism.
