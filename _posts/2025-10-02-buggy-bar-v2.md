It's been 5 years sine my last release, but the Buggy bar has continued to evolve the entire time. The new design looks very similar but its changed enough that many components are not compatible with version 1.1.0, so the new bar is called [_BuggyBar v2_](../assets/documents/buggy_bar_v2/). 

The new design is still a 4.5 line bar with a clam cleat. The trimmable portion of the trim line now has a core to improve its grip in the Aerocleat. With the core installed, the cleat has a solid bite and it has never slipped. 

The cleat bead now has a set screw to lock it to the trim and cleat. This keeps the flier from pulling it off the cleat. The wall of the bead is a little thin so the V2 design references a new 3-D model with a thicker wall at the set screw.

The big change in the Buggy Bar is the move from a chicken loop to a [KQR](https://orangekiter.jimdofree.com/kieler-quickrelease/). The KQR is awell-engineered, short, quick-release with an integrated swivel and leash. The complex part of the KQR attaches to your harness while the bar needs only a pair of rings and a small 3D-printed ring holder to connect to the harness-side and retain the flag line ring. If you have multiple bars, each needs a pair of rings and the holder. This keeps the cost per bar low. This is great if you own ten bars.

The KQR ring-set attaches to a loop at the bottom of the trim line. This can attach to the doubled trimline of the older Buggy Bars, but I've phased that out in the new design in favor of a brummel-spliced loop in the trim line. This simplifies the trimline connection at the cleat. With this change, moving the cleat along the trim line will require corresponding adjustments on the steering lines to keep the kite trim even.

The spliced portion of the new trim line loop is about 8mm in diameter, so the existing separation block has to be drilled out to 7.5mm or replaced with the new 3D model referenced in the V2 design. This allows the loop to pass through the separation block's center bore.

[BuggyBar v2](../assets/documents/buggy_bar_v2/) is available online only at this time.
